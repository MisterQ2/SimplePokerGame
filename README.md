# SimplePokerGame
This is my first project. It's a poker game that I made using self-taught java skills on NetBeans. The actual poker game has a few bugs with chip amounts, but the hand-strength checker should work fine - the code should be able to discern what type of hand you have (high card, pairs, straight, flush, etc.). This project was made using Java 24.0.1.
