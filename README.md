# SimplePokerGame
To access this program, simply copy and paste the code into an IDE which can run Java 24.0.1.

When run, this program should be able to play a heads up poker game between the user and the computer. The game runs on console.

The user can choose the amount of chips to buy in with, and the computer will match this stack. From there, a standard poker game will commence, with Pre-Flop, Flop, Turn, and River betting rounds. After this, the game will proceed to showdown, where the winner and the players' new balances will be declared. The user can decide whether to play another round or quit.

There is also a Statistical Simulations option which, rather than having the user play through a game of poker against the computer, runs through a bunch of simulated games to calculate players' equities during certain situations. You can manually edit the code to set up whatever situation you want, set the number of trials you want to run through (more trials = less sampling variation), and the program will calculate percentages for the user's equity and the computer's equity during the situation.
