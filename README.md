# SimplePokerGame
This is my first project. It's a poker game that I made using self-taught java skills on NetBeans. The actual poker game and AI bot are kind of buggy (numbers sometimes get mixed up with betting and All Ins), but the hand-strength checker should work fine. The code should be able to discern what type of hand you have (pair, straight, flush, etc.).
