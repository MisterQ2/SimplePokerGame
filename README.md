When run, this program should be able to play a heads up poker game between the user and the computer.

The user can choose the amount of chips to buy in with, and the computer will match this stack. From there, a standard poker game will commence, with Pre-Flop, Flop, Turn, and River betting rounds. After this, the game will proceed to showdown, where the winner and the players' new balances will be declared. The user can decide whether to play another round or quit.
